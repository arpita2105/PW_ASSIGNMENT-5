## FAVICON
A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon or image that is typically displayed in a web browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks to represent a website. It helps users easily identify and distinguish websites when they have multiple tabs open or when bookmarking sites. Favicon files are usually in the .ico format and are specified in a website's HTML code using a `<link>` tag in the header.
