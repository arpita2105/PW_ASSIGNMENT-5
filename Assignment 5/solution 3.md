## META TAGS
Meta tags are snippets of HTML code placed within the `<head>` section of a webpage. They provide information about the webpage's content, structure, and properties to web browsers and search engines. Meta tags are not visible on the webpage itself but play a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO), user experience, and content presentation.`<meta>` tags always go inside the `<head>` element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. Common types of meta tags include meta titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and others, each serving specific purposes in web development and online visibility.
